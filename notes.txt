FOR A SINGLE POST
need: A user object or acess to users to display post information
    - username, location?, time posted
    - preliminary POST format : {
        user:obj,
        currentUserId:str|num,
        id,
        timeStamp:str,
        location?:str?,
        likes:num,
        comments:arr,
        commentCount:num
        isBookmarked:bool
    }

Make a component for UserProfilePic?
    - need to re-use this for the current user and for all users in `posts`

if things freeze up, try commenting out the images being loaded from picsum.photos
    - in Nav

<Post /> structure
    <div className="POST-HEADER"></div>
    <img className="POST-PIC" src="" alt="" />
    <div className="POST-INTERACTIONS"></div>
    <div className="POST-COMMENTS"></div>
